    description= _ "Mehsi incite fear and awe in miners and explorers, figuring often in folklore as wrathful deities of the underground. Capable of destroying carts effortlessly, and possessed of seemingly endless strength and vitality, these elusive leviathans are destructive and relentless to any who try to combat them. Generally living in the deep, Mehsi are imposing even to the elite dwarven warriors, and are the reason they seldom inhabit tunnels close to the surface."

Enemy units cannot see this unit while it is underground, except if they have units next to it. Any enemy unit that first discovers this unit immediately loses all its remaining movement."
