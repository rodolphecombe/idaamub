    description= _ "This curious machine looks like a Dunefolk Scorcher made out of metal. The scorcherâ€™s moniker is derived not from the destruction they wreak on adversarial formations, but on their own singed appearances. By experimenting endlessly with the equipment, goblins inevitably overstep their bounds at some point and scrochers are seared by the highly volatile Sanbaar sap that soaks their weapons. These machines relish igniting great swaths of flame on the battlefield, though this sometimes also results in unintended friendly fire."
